# Tinc VPN
Configurations for a Tinc VPN setup. This is a working rough draft.

## Dependencies

$ sudo apt-get install tinc

### OSX

Follow the directions of the `brew` caveats of formula.
You may need to reboot for the tap/tun devices to show up.

## Installation
Move the contents of this repo to the tinc directory on your system.
Edit as needed.

## Issues
Don't forget to unblock the firewall.
